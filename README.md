## Overview
A POC (proof of concept) application game to try making a multicast server.

## What's used
It's using swing and more precisely JFrame, JPanels and JLabels.
To instance Cubes, the ModifyImage script is used to change colors.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to make an optimised server creating instances of cubes running on different threads on every connection request.
Or simpler just to test a bad multicast server (really bad).
